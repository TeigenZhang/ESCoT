You are still you, with unique passions and interests.\nseeker: That's a good point. Sometimes it's hard to separate myself from it.\nsupporter: So it sounds like you've felt very consumed by your illness and it's been difficult to see things outside of that.\nseeker: Yes, exactly.\nsupporter: Is there anything you feel like you can do to take more control over your situation?\nseeker: I've been trying to stay on top of things with my treatment and medication, but it can be overwhelming at times.\nsupporter: Have you talked to your healthcare provider about resources or ways to manage this better?\nseeker: No, I haven't thought to ask.

What did that look like?\nseeker: Hmm, let me think... I remember when I made a schedule for myself and stuck to it really strictly.

You don't have to go into detail about your future plans if you're not ready to share them, but you can let them know that you need more time to figure out what you want for yourself before you make any big decisions.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I'm just afraid that they won't understand or will get upset with me.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is writing down a few key points you want to make before the conversation, and practicing saying them out loud to yourself.

Is it always about the pay, or do you value the work itself more?\nseeker: I think I value the work itself more.

It's an important factor to consider when making this decision.\nseeker: That's true, I just worry I won't be able to pay my bills on the other job.\nsupporter: It seems like financial stability and security are really important to you. Is that accurate?\nseeker: Yes, it is.\nsupporter: Have you looked at other options for making ends meet?

How do you feel in each scenario?\nseeker: In the high-paying job, I feel worried and stressed all the time. In the other job, I feel fulfilled and happy.\nsupporter: That's great information to have. It sounds like the lower-paying job is really the one that aligns with your values and brings you happiness.\nseeker: Yeah, it does.\nsupporter: Remember, it's ultimately up to you to make the decision. You have the power to choose the job that will bring you the most joy and fulfillment.\nseeker: Thank you for reminding me of that.\nsupporter: How have you been taking care of yourself during this tough decision-making process?\nseeker: I've been trying to go for walks and listen to calming music. It helps a bit.\nsupporter: When I'm facing a tough decision, I find that meditation and journaling can be helpful. Would you be interested in trying that?\nseeker: That could work. I've never really tried meditation before.\nsupporter: Can you give me some concrete examples of how each job would impact your day-to-day life differently?\nseeker: Well, the high-paying job would allow me to buy a nicer car and maybe even a house, but the other job would allow me to make a difference in people's lives and feel good about myself.\nsupporter: Which of those benefits do you value more? Material possessions, or making a difference in the world?\nseeker: I think I value making a difference more.\nsupporter: It can be hard to prioritize what we want in life, especially when there are so many factors at play.

Lately, it's been weighing me down, and I'm not sure how to cope.\nsupporter: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit about your illness and how it impacts your daily life?\nseeker: I have Lupus, which is an autoimmune disease that targets healthy cells and tissues in my body. It can lead to a wide range of symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, and a weakened immune system, making it difficult to carry out everyday activities.\nsupporter: It sounds like Lupus can cause challenges both physically and mentally. Is there anything that has been helpful for you in managing your symptoms so far?\nseeker: I have been taking medication regularly, but it can be pretty overwhelming. I also try to stick to a healthy diet, exercise routine, and get enough rest, but sometimes I feel like it's not enough.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're doing everything you can, but the management of Lupus can still be overwhelming and frustrating. Is that right?\nseeker: Yes, absolutely.\nsupporter: I want to affirm your strength in managing something so challenging every day. It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel frustrated and overwhelmed at times. These feelings are valid, and you're doing the best you can.\nseeker: Thank you.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about which particular activity you find the most challenging to carry out?\nseeker: Sure. Daily household chores like cleaning and cooking can be excruciatingly tiring. The joint pain I mentioned earlier makes it hard to complete these tasks, and I end up feeling drained.\nsupporter: One idea could be to break down household chores into smaller tasks. Instead of cleaning the whole house in one day, try to manage one room at a time. This would also allow you to break for rest periods in between tasks.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I'll give it a try.\nsupporter: So, dividing household chores into smaller tasks can be more manageable for you. Is that right?\nseeker: Yes, it makes sense.\nsupporter: I'm curious, have you talked to someone about your feelings towards the illness?\nseeker: Not really, I don't want to burden anyone with my own struggles.\nsupporter: It's understandable to feel that way, but it's also important to have someone to talk to, whether it's a therapist, support group, or a close friend or family member. You don't have to go through this alone, and it's important to take care of your mental health too.\nseeker: That's a good point.\nsupporter: It seems like you're hesitant about reaching out for support. Can you share more about how you're feeling about that?\nseeker: I just feel like it's too much to ask of others. I should be able to manage my own illness, and I don't want others to think I'm weak or dependent.\nsupporter: I hear you, and that's completely valid, but it might also be useful to remember that we all need support from time to time. It takes strength to reach out for help, and it's not a weakness. I have also struggled with that in the past, and it has been helpful for me to talk to a therapist or a support group.\nseeker: That's reassuring to hear.\nsupporter: I would like you to consider looking for a support group or therapist in your area. It can be helpful to talk about your feelings and experiences with others who understand what you're going through.\nseeker: Okay, I'll start looking.\nsupporter: I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate you taking the time to share with me. It takes a lot of courage to be open about struggles like this.\nseeker: Thank you, it feels good to talk about it.\nsupporter: From what you've shared, it sounds like you're resilient and adaptable in managing your illness.

And in exposure therapy, you will be gradually exposed to heights in a controlled and safe setting, while learning to cope with the anxiety that may come up.\nseeker: That sounds scary, but worth a try.\nsupporter: Can you imagine yourself successfully conquering your fear of heights and how that would feel?\nseeker: Hmm, that's difficult.

What are the biggest drains on your finances?\nseeker: Rent, utilities, and groceries are the biggest expenses.\nsupporter: Can you be more specific about where your money is going in these categories?\nseeker: Well, my rent is high and I have a few monthly subscriptions that add up. I also tend to overspend on groceries.\nsupporter: Have you considered downsizing your living space or negotiating a lower rent with your landlord?

I'm not used to feeling so lost and unsure of myself.\nsupporter: One suggestion for you to try is to write down your core beliefs and values.

That way, it's not as overwhelming as thinking about committing to attending every single session.\nseeker: That's a good idea. It feels more manageable.\nsupporter: It sounds like breaking it down into smaller steps and setting manageable goals may be helpful for you.\nseeker: Yes, definitely.\nsupporter: I just want to remind you that it's okay to take your time with this. Managing social anxiety can be a long process, but the fact that you're here seeking support shows that you're willing to put in the effort.\nseeker: Thank you, that really means a lot.\nsupporter: One thing to help alleviate some of the stress associated with social anxiety is to visualize yourself in a safe space. It can be anything from a calming beach to a cozy cabin in the woods. When you feel anxious, try to imagine yourself in that space and stay there for a few minutes.\nseeker: That's a great idea, I've never thought of that before.\nsupporter: Can you think of any specific situations that make you feel particularly anxious?\nseeker: Going to parties or big social events is definitely the worst for me.\nsupporter: One thing to consider is arriving early to the event. That way, you can get a feel for the space and the people before it gets too crowded.\nseeker: That's a great tip, thank you.\nsupporter: I just want to say that I really appreciate you opening up to me and trusting me enough to share your experiences. It takes a lot of courage to do that.\nseeker: Thank you, I really appreciate your support.",

That can make it easier to keep track of your payments and avoid costly fees.\nseeker: That sounds like a good idea.

I'll try that.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about why you're feeling unqualified? Is it because of your academic background or experience?\nseeker: I think it's a combination of both. My degree is in a really competitive field and I don't have a lot of experience yet.\nsupporter: Did you know that a lot of people struggle with finding a job after graduation? It's a common experience. Also, there are many jobs out there that don’t explicitly require a certain degree or a certain amount of experience.\nseeker: No, I didn't know that. It makes me feel better knowing that I'm not alone.\nsupporter: You definitely aren't alone.

For homework, can you research a few specific positions or companies you're interested in and make a plan to reach out to them?\nseeker: Yes, I can do that.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that finding a job isn't entirely within your control, but you can take charge of things like reaching out to companies and putting yourself out there.\nseeker: That makes sense.\nsupporter: It's possible that your rejections aren't necessarily about your qualifications, but rather about the current job market. Sometimes, there are just a ton of qualified candidates applying for the same position.\nseeker: That's reassuring to hear.\nsupporter: Can you tell me about one specific rejection you've experienced and what you learned from it?\nseeker: Well, I applied for a job that I really wanted, but I didn't hear back from the company.

Would you be open to exploring those options?\nseeker: I'm not sure. I feel like maybe I should be able to handle this on my own.\nsupporter: It's okay to need help sometimes. You're not weak or less capable because you're struggling right now.

I want to feel like myself again.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're really longing for a sense of normalcy, to feel more like you did before this happened.\nseeker: Exactly.\nsupporter: It's important to give yourself permission to take things at your own pace.

I've been eating a lot of takeout and staying up late.\nsupporter: Can you give me one example of something you've been eating a lot of?\nseeker: Yeah, I've been ordering pizza a lot. It's just easy and convenient.\nsupporter: It's understandable that you might not feel like cooking, but maybe you could try to meal prep some healthier options.

I feel like I don't have any time for myself anymore and I'm not sure how to balance everything.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is setting aside some time for yourself each day, even if it's just 10-15 minutes, to do something that you enjoy.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I just feel so guilty for taking any time for myself when there's so much to do.\nsupporter: It's really important to take care of yourself so you can take care of your baby.

But what if I make a mistake and mess everything up?\nsupporter: It sounds like you're really worried about making mistakes and the impact they might have.\nseeker: Yes, exactly. I want to be the best parent I can be, but I'm so scared of doing something wrong.\nsupporter: It's completely understandable to feel that way, but it's important to remember that parenting is a learning process. Making mistakes is part of that process, and it doesn't make you a bad parent. It's how you handle those mistakes and learn from them that matters.\nseeker: That's a good perspective to have.

That's a really important part of being a parent.\nseeker: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind.

It's so frustrating and overwhelming.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that sometimes babies just cry and there's no obvious reason.

How would it make you feel?\nseeker: I think it would take a lot of pressure off of me and relieve some of my anxiety.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're focusing on the negative aspects of the move right now. Have you thought about some of the positive aspects of your new city? Maybe there are new experiences you can have that you wouldn't have had in your old city.\nseeker: That's true. I suppose I could research some of the cultural events or attractions in the area.\nsupporter: What other aspects of the move are worrying you?\nseeker: I'm also stressed about finding a new place to live.

I'll look into that.\nsupporter: It seems like you're feeling overwhelmed with all the changes and adjustments you'll need to make in the new city.\nseeker: Yes, it feels like a lot to handle right now.\nsupporter: It's important that you take it one step at a time and not let it all consume you.

I'm pretty much on my own with this.\nsupporter: Imagine what it would be like to have a trusted friend or family member to help guide you through this process. How would that make you feel?\nseeker: It would definitely help to have someone to talk to and get advice from. I just don't want to burden anyone.\nsupporter: It's okay to ask for help when you need it. Nobody can do everything on their own.\nseeker: Thank you. That makes me feel better.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're feeling isolated and alone through this process. That can be tough to deal with.\nseeker: Yes, it is. I just wish I had more support around me right now.\nsupporter: I remember feeling the same way when I moved to a new city.

It could be worth it to look into those and see if they could help you find some strategies for managing your stress.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that.\nsupporter: When I was in a similar situation at work, I found that setting clear boundaries between work and my personal life helped me to feel more in control of my time. Would that be something that could help you?\nseeker: Maybe, but I feel like I always have work looming over me no matter what time it is. It's hard for me to switch off.\nsupporter: And that's totally understandable. It's really tough to be in that kind of situation. But there are some tools and strategies we can look at that might make things a little easier for you.\nseeker: Okay, I'm willing to try.\nsupporter: One thing we could try is setting aside a little bit of time each day to work on just one task or project, so that you're not trying to tackle everything at once.

He doesn't take hygiene seriously, and I don't know how to bring it up without offending him.\nsupporter: I can understand that it must be frustrating to live with someone who does not take hygiene seriously. It must be hard to find a way to address it without offending them.\nseeker: Yes, exactly! I feel like I've tried everything, but nothing seems to work.\nsupporter: Have you tried talking to him about how his lack of hygiene is affecting you? Maybe approach it from the angle of it bothering you rather than attacking him for his behavior.\nseeker: I have tried talking to him, but he always seems to get defensive.\nsupporter: It sounds like you've already tried to address the issue, but it hasn't worked so far. Is that correct?\nseeker: Yes, that's exactly it.\nsupporter: Can you tell me a little bit more about how your roommate's lack of hygiene is affecting you?\nseeker: Well, there's constantly a bad smell in the apartment, and it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed when we have guests over.\nsupporter: That sounds really tough to deal with. It's completely understandable that you feel embarrassed.\nseeker: Yes, it is. I just wish there was a way to get him to take his hygiene seriously.\nsupporter: Can you think of any specific examples of things your roommate does that bother you?\nseeker: He doesn't shower regularly, he leaves dirty dishes in the sink for days, and he doesn't clean up after himself in the bathroom.\nsupporter: Did you know that poor hygiene can actually lead to health problems, like infections and outbreaks of illnesses?\nseeker: I didn't know that, but I'm not sure how I could use that information to get my roommate to take his hygiene more seriously.\nsupporter: Can you imagine what it would be like if the roles were reversed? If you were the one with poor hygiene and your roommate had to deal with it?\nseeker: I guess I would feel really bad and want to change my behavior.\nsupporter: So it sounds like you're looking for a way to help your roommate see how his behavior is affecting you and find a solution that works for both of you.\nseeker: Yes, that's exactly it.\nsupporter: It's possible that your roommate doesn't realize how his lack of hygiene is affecting you. Is there a way to communicate your concerns to him in a gentle but direct way?\nseeker: I'm not sure. I feel like I've tried everything.\nsupporter: I've had a roommate like that before, and what worked for me was being firm but polite. I made it clear that his lack of hygiene was affecting me and that I would appreciate it if he could make more of an effort to clean up after himself.\nseeker: That sounds like good advice. I'll give it a try.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is sitting down with your roommate and having an open and honest conversation about how you feel. You could also come up with some concrete solutions together, like agreeing on a cleaning schedule or dividing up household chores.\nseeker: That's a good idea. I think I'll try that.\nsupporter: Can you visualize yourself having this conversation with your roommate? How do you think it will go?\nseeker: I'm not sure. I'm a little nervous about it, but I hope it will lead to a positive outcome.\nsupporter: I have faith in you. You clearly care about finding a solution to this problem, and I'm sure you'll be able to work it out with your roommate.\nseeker: Thank you. That means a lot to me.\nsupporter: I wonder if there are any underlying issues that could be causing your roommate to neglect his hygiene. Maybe he's going through a tough time or feeling depressed.\nseeker: That's a good point. I never thought about that.\nsupporter: Have you noticed any changes in your roommate's behavior or mood lately?\nseeker: Now that you mention it, he has seemed a little down lately.\nsupporter: It might be worth checking in with him to see if everything is okay. Sometimes just knowing that someone cares can make a big difference.\nseeker: You're right. I think I'll talk to him about it.\nsupporter: Another thing you could try is doing something nice for your roommate, like cooking dinner or watching a movie together. Maybe this will help improve your relationship and make it easier to talk to him about the hygiene issue.\nseeker: That's a great idea. I think I'll give it a try. Thanks for your help!",

Can you tell me more about what's happening and what's making you feel overwhelmed?\nseeker: I just had my first child, and everything seems so new to me. I'm worried that I'm not doing things right, that I might hurt my baby, and that I might not be giving her enough attention.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're struggling with self-doubt and anxiety about how to care for your child. Can you give me an example of what's worrying you the most?\nseeker: One of my biggest worries is trying to figure out if my baby is getting enough milk since I'm breastfeeding and it's hard to determine how much she's taking in.\nsupporter: One way to know whether your baby is getting enough milk is to keep track of her weight gain and her diaper output. If she's growing at a healthy rate and having regular bowel movements and wet diapers, then she's likely getting enough milk.\nseeker: Thank you for that information. I'll definitely start keeping track of those things.\nsupporter: How have you been taking care of yourself? Are you getting enough rest and eating healthy foods?\nseeker: Honestly, I've been neglecting my own needs lately. It's hard to find the time to take care of myself when I'm so focused on taking care of my baby.\nsupporter: I can understand that it's difficult to prioritize your own needs when you have so much going on. Have you considered setting some time aside each day just for yourself, even if it's just a few minutes to relax or do something you enjoy?\nseeker: That's a good idea. I think I can fit in some self-care time after my baby goes to sleep.\nsupporter: You're doing a great job as a new parent, and it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed and anxious. Remember to be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time.\nseeker: Thank you so much for your support. It really helps to hear that from someone.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of a specific situation that has been challenging for you as a new parent?\nseeker: One time I was trying to change my baby's diaper, and she kept crying and squirming, and I just felt like I couldn't keep her still.\nsupporter: It sounds like you felt frustrated and unsure of what to do in that moment. Is that accurate?\nseeker: Yes, definitely.\nsupporter: It seems like you're feeling overwhelmed and self-doubting as a new parent, and are finding it hard to prioritize your own needs.\nseeker: That's on point, yes.\nsupporter: It's completely understandable to feel this way. Being a new parent can be both rewarding and extremely challenging. It's okay to not have all the answers and to make mistakes along the way.\nseeker: Thank you for saying that. I don't really hear that from anyone.\nsupporter: One thing you could try is reaching out to other new parents or joining a support group. It can be helpful to connect with others who are going through similar experiences and to share advice and support.\nseeker: I hadn't thought of that. I'll look into it.\nsupporter: Another thing you could try is speaking with a healthcare professional or a lactation consultant to get more guidance and support with breastfeeding.\nseeker: I think that would be a good idea. I'll talk to my doctor about it.\nsupporter: I just want to say that I really admire your strength and courage as a new parent. It's not easy, but you're doing an amazing job.\nseeker: Thank you so much. That means a lot to me.\nsupporter: Remember that it's okay to ask for help when you need it. You don't have to do everything on your own.\nseeker: That's something I definitely need to work on. I always feel like I have to handle everything myself.\nsupporter: I completely understand that feeling. When I was a new parent, I felt the same way. But I learned that it's okay to ask for help and that it actually made me a better parent.\nseeker: Hearing that really helps. Thank you for sharing.\nsupporter: Are there any other specific challenges you're facing as a new parent that you'd like to talk about?\nseeker: Well, I'm also worried about getting back to work and balancing my career with my responsibilities as a parent.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of what's worrying you about returning to work?\nseeker: I'm worried that I won't be able to focus on my job because I'll always be thinking about my baby, or that I won't be able to spend enough time with her because of my job.\nsupporter: So it seems like you're concerned about finding a balance between your career and your responsibilities as a parent.\nseeker: Exactly.\nsupporter: One thing you could do is speak with your employer about flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or a modified schedule, to help you balance both responsibilities.\nseeker: I hadn't thought of that. I'll see if that's an option.\nsupporter: It's important to remember that being a parent and having a career are both important aspects of your life, and it's possible to find a balance between them.\nseeker: Thank you for saying that.

I'll definitely look into that.\nsupporter: Are there any obstacles or challenges that make it difficult for you to pursue your passions?\nseeker: One major challenge is that I'm worried about taking the risk of leaving my current job and not being able to find something better.\nsupporter: It's understandable to have concerns about taking a risk, but remember that taking a leap of faith and pursuing your passions can be incredibly rewarding. You also have the capabilities and strengths to find something new and fulfilling.\nseeker: I appreciate your support and encouragement.\nsupporter: Have you considered making a list of potential pros and cons of pursuing a new career?\nseeker: That's a good idea. I think I've been focusing too much on the potential negatives and not enough on the positives.\nsupporter: Maybe over the next few days, you could try jotting down some ideas of what you'd like to pursue and what the benefits could be of a new career.

It's hard to move on from someone who was such a big part of my life.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're having a tough time with this breakup, and it's understandable that you're feeling sad and lost.\nsupporter: I want you to know that you're a strong person and you will get through this. It takes time and patience, but you'll get there.\nseeker: I appreciate that. It just feels like it's going to be forever until I can feel better.\nsupporter: What do you think would be helpful for you in this situation?\nseeker: I don't know, I feel like I've been trying everything to distract myself, but nothing seems to work.\nsupporter: Can you give me an example of something you've tried?\nseeker: Yeah, I tried going out with friends and going to the gym, but it just doesn't seem to help for very long.\nsupporter: It's normal to feel like nothing is working at first. Healing from a breakup takes time and effort, but there are some things you can do to help the process. Have you ever thought about starting a new hobby or activity to keep you occupied?\nseeker: No, I haven't really thought about that before.\nsupporter: Starting a new activity or hobby can help take your mind off things and give you something positive to focus on. It can also introduce you to new people and experiences. Maybe you could try out a painting class or join a sports league?\nseeker: That actually sounds like a good idea. I'll look into that.\nsupporter: That's great. How about as a homework assignment for this week, you research some hobbies or activities that you're interested in and make a plan to try one out?\nseeker: Okay, I can do that. Thanks for the suggestion.\nsupporter: It can be hard to feel motivated after a breakup, but it sounds like you're willing to try new things to help you feel better.\nseeker: Yeah, I know I need to do something to get out of this rut. It's just hard to know where to start.\nsupporter: What other things are you struggling with since the breakup?\nseeker: I guess I'm struggling with feeling like I'll never find someone again. I thought this relationship was going to last forever.\nsupporter: It sounds like you're scared that you won't be able to find love again. Is that right?\nseeker: Yeah, I guess so.\nsupporter: It's totally normal to feel that way after a breakup. But remember, this relationship ending doesn't define you or your future. You're an amazing person and you'll find love again when the time is right.\nseeker: Thank you, I really needed to hear that.\nsupporter: I've been through a tough breakup before too, and I remember feeling like I would never find someone again. But eventually, I did, and I'm so glad I allowed myself to love again.\nseeker: That's really nice to hear. I hope I can get there too someday.\nsupporter: Have you thought about talking to a therapist or counselor about your feelings?\nseeker: I have thought about it, but I haven't really looked into it.\nsupporter: Seeing a therapist or counselor can be really helpful in dealing with the emotions that come with a breakup. It's also a safe space to talk about things you might not feel comfortable sharing with friends or family.",

You are so brave for reaching out for help.\nsupporter: It takes a lot of courage to leave an abusive relationship.

Have you explored any of these options?\nseeker: I haven’t yet. I don’t even know where to start.\nsupporter: That sounds really overwhelming. It’s understandable that you might not know where to begin.\nsupporter: Have you thought about talking to a counselor or therapist who specializes in domestic abuse? They could help you sort through your options and provide emotional support.\nseeker: That’s a good idea. I’ve been hesitant to reach out to anyone, but maybe that would be a good first step.\nsupporter: That's great! You're taking a step towards healing and empowerment.\nsupporter: I suggest that you consider writing down your thoughts and feelings about the situation in a journal or notebook. It can be helpful to have a safe space to process your emotions and track your progress.\nseeker: That’s a good idea. It’s hard to organize my thoughts right now.\nsupporter: I hear you. It can be easy to feel overwhelmed by everything that's going on.\nsupporter: How have you been coping with the abuse thus far?\nseeker: I've been trying to avoid my partner as much as possible and keep my head down when I'm around them.

It can be helpful to have a plan in place in case you need to leave quickly.\nseeker: That's a good idea. What should I include in the plan?\nsupporter: You could include important documents such as identification, money, and a change of clothes in a safe place, and have a list of emergency contacts and where to go in case you need to leave quickly.\nsupporter: So to recap, we talked about exploring resources such as local shelters and counseling services, considering seeing a therapist, creating a safety plan, and I’ll look up the hotline number for you. How are you feeling about these ideas so far?\nseeker: I feel scared but also more empowered. It's helpful to have a plan.\nsupporter: Imagine yourself leaving the abusive situation and feeling safe and strong. What does that look like for you?\nseeker: It looks like being able to breathe and not having to worry about what might happen next.\nsupporter: That sounds like a really peaceful and safe feeling.\nsupporter: Remember that you are not to blame for the abuse you’re experiencing. It is not your fault and you deserve to feel safe and loved.\nseeker: Thank you for saying that. It’s hard to remember that when I’ve been told otherwise for so long.",

What kind of support are you getting from your friends and family?\nseeker: They're struggling too, and it breaks my heart.

I've been so focused on finding a job that I haven't had much time to do anything else.\nsupporter: I suggest taking some time to explore different hobbies or interests that you might enjoy.

It’s like I’m talking to a wall.\nsupporter: I can imagine that must feel really frustrating for you, and I wish I could help in some way.\nseeker: It just feels impossible to make any progress. I’m so tired of fighting with them all the time.\nsupporter: Have you ever considered seeing a family therapist? Sometimes it can be really helpful to have an impartial third party to help facilitate communication and work through some of these issues.\nseeker: I don’t know.

Plus, seeing a therapist could be a great way for all of you to start making some positive changes.\nseeker: What if my parents refuse to go to therapy?\nsupporter: Well, maybe you could suggest that they just come to one session to see how they feel about it. Or, if they really don’t want to go, you could still benefit from seeing a therapist on your own. It’s like how they say on airplanes that you need to put on your own oxygen mask first before you can help anyone else.\nseeker: That’s a good point.

How might that change the way you feel?\nseeker: I guess it would make me feel a lot less alone and maybe give me some hope that things can get better.\nsupporter: Can you tell me more about what specifically is making you feel so misunderstood?\nseeker: Well, it's frustrating because people seem to think that I should be able to just \"push through\" my illness and not let it affect my life, but it's not that simple.\nsupporter: Did you know that many people with chronic illnesses struggle with feeling like they're not taken seriously by others? It's unfortunately a very common experience.\nseeker: I didn't know that, but it makes me feel a bit better to know that I'm not alone in this.\nsupporter: Absolutely, you're not alone in this at all.

I went through something similar when I was going through a tough time a few years ago.\nseeker: Really? It helps to know that other people have gone through this too.\nsupporter: It must be so difficult to feel like you're not being taken seriously by people close to you and to battle your illness every day.
